- Backlash due to poor framing or tone

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### If Post Doesn't Gain Traction
- Consider whether timing was wrong
- Evaluate if framing missed the mark
- Look at who did engage (even if numbers are low)
- Mine comments for insights about positioning
- Don't delete or over-analyze (not every post will perform)

### If Discussion Goes Negative
- Don't respond defensively or argumentatively
- Acknowledge valid criticisms gracefully
- Clarify misunderstandings once, then move on
- Take heated discussion to private channels
- Know when to stop responding

### If You Miss the Mark
- Acknowledge openly if you got something wrong
- Use as learning opportunity
- Don't over-apologize or self-flagellate
- Move forward with better framing next time

## Continuous Improvement

### After Each Promotion Campaign
- Which platforms drove best engagement?
- What framing or angles worked best?
- What relationships or opportunities emerged?
- What would you do differently?
- What follow-up content does this suggest?

### Pattern Recognition
- Which topics consistently resonate?
- Which platforms are most effective for different content types?
- How is your network evolving?
- What themes are emerging in discussions?

## Special Situations

### Time-Sensitive Content
- Prioritize platforms with fast engagement (Twitter, HN)
- Consider posting at optimal times even if requires scheduling
- Be prepared to engage actively in first few hours
- Plan follow-up content if discussion takes off

### Controversial Topics
- Anticipate objections in initial framing
- Be more careful with tone and precision
- Prepare for more active engagement management
- Consider which platforms can handle nuanced discussion

### Technical Deep Dives
- Prioritize platforms with technical audiences (HN, specific subreddits)
- May skip or minimize less technical platforms
- Expect slower but higher-quality engagement
- Be prepared to answer detailed technical questions

### Strategic/Business Content
- LinkedIn becomes primary platform
- Twitter/X good for reaching specific communities
- Consider timing with business news cycles
- Frame in terms of decisions and tradeoffs, not just analysis
