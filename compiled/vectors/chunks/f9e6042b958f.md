## HOW TO USE THIS RUNBOOK

This runbook is designed to be **both comprehensive AND practical**. Not every project needs every check. 

### Step 1: Assess Your Project Tier

Start by completing the **Project Complexity Assessment** below. This determines which tier your project falls into and which sections apply.

### Step 2: Review Applicable Sections

Each section and many individual items are marked with tier indicators:
- 🟢 **Essential** (Tier 1) - Apply to ALL projects, even weekend hacks
- 🔵 **Standard** (Tier 2) - Apply to team projects and production apps  
- 🟣 **Enterprise** (Tier 3) - Apply to large-scale, multi-team, or regulated systems
- ⚫ **Mission-Critical** (Tier 4) - Apply to financial, healthcare, infrastructure, or high-stakes systems

### Step 3: Skip What Doesn't Apply

- If you're Tier 1, focus only on 🟢 items (~50 checks)
- If you're Tier 2, include 🟢 and 🔵 items (~150 checks)
- If you're Tier 3, include 🟢, 🔵, and 🟣 items (~400 checks)
- If you're Tier 4, include everything (~900+ checks)

### Step 4: Use the Quick Start (Optional)

If you want a rapid assessment, use the **Minimum Viable Review** section for a 15-minute health check.
