 sentences for complex ideas, varied paragraph lengths for pacing.

**Detection tip:** Scan the visual structure of text. AI-generated content often looks like uniform blocks.

**The fix:** Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences can carry complexity when needed, building toward a point with subordinate clauses and careful construction. Some paragraphs should be brief. Others need room to develop.

## Style and Structural Indicators

### 11. Excessive Use of Em Dashes

**Pattern:** Overuse of em dashes (—) where humans would use commas, parentheses, or colons.

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs were trained on professional writing where em dashes appear more frequently than in casual or journalistic writing. They default to em dashes for all parenthetical insertions.

**Note:** This indicator has limited shelf life as AI systems learn to avoid it. However, in combination with other patterns, it remains useful.

**Human pattern:** Uses varied punctuation (parentheses for asides, commas for clauses, colons for elaboration).

**The fix:** Use the punctuation mark that best fits the function. Em dashes for dramatic interruption or emphasis. Parentheses for true asides. Commas for standard clauses.

### 12. Bulleted Lists with Bolded Lead-ins

**Pattern:** Formulaic bullet points where each item begins with a bolded term followed by a colon and explanation.

**Structure:**

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale easily.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to various use cases.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource utilization.

**Why this signals AI:** This structure appears in AI-generated content far more than in human journalism or blog writing. Humans vary their list formats more naturally.

**Detection tip:** This pattern is especially strong when combined with generic bolded terms that simply restate what follows.

**The fix:** Vary list formats. Sometimes bullets without bold leads work better. Sometimes a numbered list fits. Sometimes prose serves better than a list at all.

### 13. Excessive Bolding and Formatting

**Pattern:** Mechanical, over-consistent use of bold text for key terms throughout an article.

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs sometimes emphasize terms they deem "important" without understanding that excessive formatting reduces readability.

**Human pattern:** Strategic use of formatting—headlines, subheads, occasional emphasis, but not mechanical bolding of every "important" term.

**The fix:** Bold sparingly. If everything is emphasized, nothing is.

### 14. Emoji Usage in Inappropriate Contexts

**Pattern:** Emojis appearing in article text, headers, or formal content where they don't belong.

**Why this signals AI:** Some LLMs insert emojis to "add emotion" or "engage readers," but do so without understanding context or audience appropriateness.

**Note:** Emojis in social media posts, casual blogs, or intentionally informal content are normal. The tell is their appearance in contexts where they're inappropriate.

### 15. Markdown Formatting Mixed with Standard Text

**Pattern:** Presence of Markdown syntax elements in published content.

**Common artifacts:**

- Asterisks for bold/italic: `*emphasis*` or `**strong**`
- Underscores for emphasis: `_italic_`
- Hash symbols for headers: `## Section Title`
- Backticks for code: `` `inline code` ``
- Triple backticks: ```` ```code block``` ````
- Numbers with periods for lists when not rendered: `1. First item`

**Why this happens:** LLMs are trained to output Markdown (used on GitHub, Reddit, Discord, etc.) and sometimes don't translate correctly to the target platform's formatting.

### 16. Curly vs. Straight Quotes

**Pattern:** Inconsistent use of curly quotes (") versus straight quotes (") or the wrong type for the context.

**Why this signals AI:** Different training data and platforms use different quote styles. LLMs may insert curly quotes in contexts where straight quotes are s
