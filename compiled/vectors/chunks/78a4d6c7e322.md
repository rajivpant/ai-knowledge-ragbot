- Citations repeated multiple times without proper reference tagging
- Real sources cited for completely unrelated content
- Citations formatted in unusual or inconsistent styles
- Multiple citations to the same source without variation in attribution
- Generic citations: "According to experts..." without naming the experts

**Example of suspicious pattern:** Multiple identical citations in close proximity rather than using a single citation or cross-referencing.

### 22. Suspiciously Long or Elaborate Edit Summaries

**Pattern:** In platforms with edit tracking, unusually long, formal edit summaries written in first-person paragraphs.

**Example:**

"Refined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance."

**Why this signals AI:** Human editors typically write brief, informal edit summaries. LLMs generate formal, comprehensive summaries when prompted to explain changes.

## Citation and Sourcing Issues

### 23. Hallucinated Citations

**Characteristics:**

- Sources that sound credible but don't exist
- Misattribution of real sources to incorrect content
- Fabricated quotes from real people
- Non-existent journal articles with plausible-sounding titles
- Books or papers by real authors that don't exist

**Why this is critical:** Hallucinated citations are one of the most dangerous aspects of AI-generated content because they appear authoritative while spreading misinformation.

### 24. Vague Attribution to Unnamed Authorities

**Pattern:** Claims attributed to generic, unnamed sources.

**Examples:**

- "Experts say..."
- "Studies have shown..."
- "Research indicates..."
- "Analysts believe..."
- "Industry leaders suggest..."

**Without specific attribution:**

- Which experts?
- Which studies?
- What research?

**Professional standard:** Specific attribution with verifiable sources.

## Context-Specific Indicators

### 25. Industry-Specific Slop Patterns

Different domains show characteristic AI patterns:

**Technology writing:**

- Overuse of "innovative," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary"
- Generic descriptions: "robust," "scalable," "flexible"
- Buzzword clustering without substance

**Travel/lifestyle:**

- "Hidden gem," "off the beaten path"
- Excessive descriptors: "picturesque," "charming," "quaint"
- Generic itineraries: "must-see destinations"

**Business/corporate:**

- "Synergy," "leverage," "optimize"
- Mission statement language throughout
- "Game-changing," "paradigm shift"

**Product reviews:**

- Uniformly positive tone
- Generic praise without specific details
- Comparison charts without actual product experience

### 26. Lack of Personal Detail, Experience, or Specificity

**Pattern:** Generic descriptions without specific examples, personal anecdotes, or experiential details.

**AI writing:**

"The restaurant offers excellent service and a diverse menu featuring both traditional and innovative dishes."

**Human writing:**

"The waiter recommended the braised short rib after learning I don't eat seafood. The meat fell apart at the touch of my fork, and the red wine reduction had a subtle coffee undertone that lingered."

**Detection principle:** Humans who have experienced something provide specific sensory details, personal reactions, and concrete examples. AI generalizes.

### 27. Superficial Depth Without Expertise

**Pattern:** Content covers a topic broadly without demonstrating actual understanding or expertise.

**Characteristics:**

- Restates common knowledge without original insight
- Uses technical terms correctly but superficially
- Avoids controversial or nuanced aspects
- Provides "both sides" artificially balanced treatment
- Lacks specific examples, case studies, or detailed analysis

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs
