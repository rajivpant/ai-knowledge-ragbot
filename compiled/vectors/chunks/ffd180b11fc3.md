erience, not self-promotion
- Intellectually curious and willing to challenge conventional wisdom
- Values precision in language and thought
- Comfortable with nuance and complexity
- Demonstrates expertise through insight, not credentials

**What Feels Inauthentic to You**
List words and patterns to avoid. Common examples:
- Words like "honored," "humbled," "excited," "thrilled," "privileged"
- Obvious statements or business platitudes
- Marketing copy or promotional language
- Excessive adjectives or superlatives
- Humble bragging or credential listing
- Corporate speak or jargon without purpose
- Manufactured enthusiasm or forced optimism
- Broad generalizations without specific insight

**Strategic Subtlety**
How do you want to demonstrate expertise? Through credentials, through analysis quality, through storytelling? Define your approach.

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### LinkedIn (Professional Network)

**Purpose:** Establish thought leadership, build professional relationships, position for board opportunities and advisory roles

**Format:** 300-600 words typically, with natural paragraph breaks

**Tone:** Professional but personal. Write as a peer sharing insights, not as someone positioning themselves above the conversation.

**Structure:**
- Open with an observation or question that creates immediate relevance
- Develop one core insight with supporting context
- Connect to broader implications for the industry or profession
- End with an invitation to engage (question, alternative perspective, call to discussion)
- URL placement should feel natural, not promotional

**What Works:**
- Connecting technical insights to business outcomes
- Sharing learned lessons from real experience
- Providing frameworks or mental models
- Challenging conventional wisdom thoughtfully
- Offering actionable perspectives

**What to Avoid:**
- Resume recitation or credential listing
- Obvious observations presented as profound insights
- Promotional language or self-congratulation
- Asking for likes, shares, or follows
- Multiple hashtags (one or two maximum, organically integrated)

**Network Engagement:**
- Only tag people if they're genuinely relevant to the discussion
- Tag at the end of the post, not in the main text
- Use tagging to invite specific perspectives, not for visibility

### Twitter/X (Real-time Discussion)

**Purpose:** Participate in industry conversations, share quick insights, build relationships with peers and thought leaders

**Format:** Thread of 2-5 tweets (280 characters each)

**Tone:** Conversational and direct. More casual than LinkedIn but still substantive.

**Structure:**
- First tweet is the hook—makes people want to read more
- Each subsequent tweet develops one idea
- Final tweet includes URL and optional invitation to continue discussion
- Each tweet should work standalone (people will quote-tweet individual thoughts)

**What Works:**
- Counterintuitive observations
- Specific examples or data points
- Questions that spark debate
- Connecting disparate ideas
- Timely reactions to industry news

**What to Avoid:**
- Thread announcements ("Thread: 1/5")
- Obvious statements for engagement farming
- Excessive emoji use
- Multiple hashtags
- "Like and retweet if you agree"

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Reply to thoughtful responses
- Quote-tweet with additional context when appropriate
- Use threads to develop ideas further if discussion warrants

### Hacker News (Technical Community)

**Purpose:** Share technical insights with startup/tech community, get feedback from sophisticated technical audience

**Format:** Title and optional comment (if self-posting)

**Tone:** Technical and substantive. This audience values depth and dislikes promotion.

**Submission Strategy:**
- Title must be factual and specific (not clickbait)
- If commenting on your own submission, add technical context or background
- Be transparent that it's your content
- Focus on what's technically interesting or novel
- Engage substantiv
