**Common overused transitions:**

- "Moreover,"
- "Furthermore,"
- "Additionally,"
- "In addition,"
- "Nevertheless,"
- "On the other hand,"
- "Consequently,"
- "As a result,"

**Why this signals AI:** While professional writing uses transitions, LLMs overrely on a narrow set and place them mechanically rather than naturally.

**Human writing:** Uses varied transitions, including implicit transitions through logical flow, rather than explicit conjunctions at every paragraph break.

**The fix:** Let ideas connect through logical flow. When transitions are needed, vary them and use the simplest option that works.

### 7. Section-Ending Summaries

**Pattern:** Paragraphs or sections end with explicit summary statements, mimicking academic essay structure.

**Common phrases:**

- "In summary,"
- "In conclusion,"
- "Overall,"
- "To summarize,"
- "Ultimately,"
- "In essence,"

**Why this is problematic:** News articles, blogs, and most media content don't summarize sections like essays. Content flows naturally to the next point without explicit meta-commentary about summarizing.

**The fix:** Remove these phrases. If your section needs a summary to be understood, the section itself may need restructuring.

### 8. The Rule of Three

**Pattern:** Grouping ideas, traits, or examples in threes—a legitimate rhetorical device that LLMs overuse formulaically.

**Common forms:**

- Three adjectives: "innovative, impactful, and transformative"
- Three short phrases: "boost morale, increase productivity, and foster collaboration"
- Three examples: "keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities"
- Three qualities: "creative, smart, and funny"

**Why LLMs overuse this:** The rule of three is prevalent in training data (human writing, marketing, speeches), so LLMs default to it as a "safe" structure.

**Human writing:** Uses varied numbers of items naturally—sometimes two, sometimes four, sometimes an uneven list. Doesn't mechanically group everything in threes.

**Detection tip:** Look for consistent triadic structure across multiple sentences/paragraphs.

**The fix:** Vary your list lengths. Sometimes two items are enough. Sometimes four or five are warranted. Let content dictate structure, not formula.

### 9. Passive Voice and "Has Been Described As" Construction

**Pattern:** Overreliance on passive constructions and indirect attribution.

**Common phrases:**

- "[Subject] has been described as..."
- "[Subject] is widely regarded as..."
- "[Subject] is considered to be..."
- "[Subject] has been praised for..."
- "[Subject] is known for..."

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs use this construction to hedge when they lack specific knowledge or sources. It creates an illusion of authority without providing actual attribution.

**The fix:** Use direct statements with specific attribution: "According to [expert/organization], [subject]..."

### 10. Uniform Sentence and Paragraph Length

**Pattern:** Mechanically consistent structure—every sentence approximately the same length, every paragraph the same size.

**Why this signals AI:** Human writing has natural rhythm and variation. Writers use short sentences for emphasis, long sentences for complex ideas, varied paragraph lengths for pacing.

**Detection tip:** Scan the visual structure of text. AI-generated content often looks like uniform blocks.

**The fix:** Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences can carry complexity when needed, building toward a point with subordinate clauses and careful construction. Some paragraphs should be brief. Others need room to develop.

## Style and Structural Indicators

### 11. Excessive Use of Em Dashes

**Pattern:** Overuse of em dashes (—) where humans would use commas, parentheses, or colons.

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs were trained on professional writing where em dashes appear more frequently than in casual or journalistic writing. They default to em dashes for al
