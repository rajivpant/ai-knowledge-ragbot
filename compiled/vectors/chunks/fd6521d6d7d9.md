## 5. CLEAN CODE & SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

### 5.1 Naming & Readability 🟢

- [ ] 🟢 **Meaningful Names**: Variables and functions have descriptive names
- [ ] 🟢 **No Magic Numbers**: Named constants instead of unexplained literals
- [ ] 🔵 **Consistent Naming**: Naming conventions applied consistently
- [ ] 🔵 **Self-Documenting**: Code intent is clear from reading it

### 5.2 Function Design 🔵

- [ ] 🔵 **Single Purpose**: Functions do one thing
- [ ] 🔵 **Few Arguments**: Functions have ≤4 arguments typically
- [ ] 🔵 **No Side Effects**: Side effects are explicit and minimized
- [ ] 🟣 **Command-Query Separation**: Functions either do or return, not both

### 5.3 SOLID Principles 🟣

- [ ] 🟣 **Single Responsibility**: Classes have one reason to change
- [ ] 🟣 **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] 🟣 **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes substitute for base
- [ ] 🟣 **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are focused
- [ ] 🟣 **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions

### 5.4 Error Handling 🟢

- [ ] 🟢 **Errors Not Swallowed**: Errors are logged or propagated
- [ ] 🟢 **User-Friendly Messages**: End users see helpful messages
- [ ] 🔵 **Specific Exceptions**: Using specific error types, not generic
- [ ] 🔵 **Error Context**: Errors include context for debugging
- [ ] 🟣 **Exception Hierarchy**: Clear exception/error type hierarchy
- [ ] 🟣 **Recovery Where Possible**: Graceful recovery when appropriate
- [ ] ⚫ **Circuit Breakers**: For external dependencies

### 5.5 Defensive Programming 🔵

- [ ] 🔵 **Input Validation**: User input validated at boundaries
- [ ] 🔵 **Null Safety**: Null/undefined handled safely
- [ ] 🟣 **Bounds Checking**: Array/collection bounds checked
- [ ] 🟣 **Type Safety**: Type system used effectively
- [ ] ⚫ **Assertions**: Invariants checked with assertions

## 6. CODE READABILITY & AI/HUMAN MAINTAINABILITY

> Code should be easily understood by both human engineers AND AI assistants.

### 6.1 Human Readability 🟢

- [ ] 🟢 **Scannable**: Code structure is clear at a glance
- [ ] 🟢 **Reasonable File Length**: Files generally under 500 lines
- [ ] 🔵 **Low Nesting**: Nesting depth ≤3-4 levels
- [ ] 🔵 **Early Returns**: Guard clauses reduce nesting
- [ ] 🟣 **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Under 10 per function

### 6.2 Documentation 🟢

- [ ] 🟢 **README Exists**: Project has a README with setup instructions
- [ ] 🔵 **Complex Logic Explained**: Non-obvious code has comments
- [ ] 🔵 **Why Comments**: Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
- [ ] 🟣 **API Documentation**: Public interfaces documented
- [ ] 🟣 **Architecture Documented**: System design is documented
- [ ] ⚫ **Runbooks Exist**: Operational procedures doc
