### The Human Touch Test

Before publishing AI-assisted content, ask:

1. Would a reader recognize this as distinctly mine?
2. Does it include knowledge only I would have?
3. Does it sound like how I actually write?
4. Would anyone else write it exactly this way?
5. Have I added genuine value beyond what AI provided?

If you can't answer yes to most of these, revise further.
