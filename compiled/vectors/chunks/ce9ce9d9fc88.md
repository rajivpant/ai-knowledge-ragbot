sts for text-heavy content
- Stories for more casual sharing

**Facebook**
- Personal network, use sparingly for professional content
- More casual tone
- Share to specific groups if highly relevant

## Content Creation Process

### Step 1: Strategic Brief (Your First Response)

Present your analysis:
- What makes this content valuable
- Platform recommendations with rationale
- Suggested emphasis for each platform
- Timing and sequencing recommendations
- Any risks or sensitivities to navigate

Wait for my feedback before proceeding.

### Step 2: Content Creation (After Approval)

For each approved platform, provide:

**Platform:** [Name]

**Strategic Approach:** [One paragraph explaining your strategy for this platform]

**Post Content:** [The actual text, formatted for the platform]

**Engagement Hook:** [What will spark discussion]

**Success Indicators:** [What good engagement looks like for this content on this platform]

**Follow-up Strategy:** [How to engage with responses]

### Step 3: Cross-Platform Coordination

**Posting Sequence:**
- Which platform to post first and why
- Spacing between platforms (avoid appearing spammy)
- Whether to customize timing based on platform algorithms

**Cross-Pollination:**
- When to reference discussion from one platform on another
- How to synthesize feedback across platforms
- Opportunities to develop follow-up content from discussions

## Engagement Management

### Responding to Comments

**Prioritize:**
- Thoughtful questions that advance discussion
- Constructive disagreement or alternative perspectives
- Comments from people you want to build relationships with
- Questions that clarify or add context

**Response Strategy:**
- Add value in every response (don't just say "thanks")
- Use questions to deepen discussion
- Acknowledge good points from dissenters
- Share additional resources when relevant
- Know when to take discussion to DM

**Avoid:**
- Defensive responses to criticism
- Arguing with trolls or bad faith actors
- Over-responding (makes you look too eager)
- Generic "thanks for reading" responses

### Discussion Evolution

**Watch For:**
- Emerging themes that suggest follow-up content
- Connections to people with aligned interests
- Misconceptions that need clarification in future writing
- Questions that reveal audience needs

**Capitalize On:**
- Unexpected engagement from specific communities
- Invitations to speak, write, or advise
- Opportunities to collaborate or connect
- Ideas that spark new content directions

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Indicators
- Engagement rate (not just volume)
- Quality of commenters (industry peers, potential collaborators)
- Inbound connection requests or opportunities
- Click-through rate to content
- Secondary sharing by influential accounts

### Qualitative Indicators
- Depth and thoughtfulness of discussion
- New relationships or connections formed
- Ideas or opportunities that emerge
- Position in relevant conversations
- Association with key topics or trends

### Red Flags
- High engagement with low substance (meme-level sharing)
- Negative discussion that doesn't advance understanding
- Engagement primarily from outside target audience
- Backlash due to poor framing or tone

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### If Post Doesn't Gain Traction
- Consider whether timing was wrong
- Evaluate if framing missed the mark
- Look at who did engage (even if numbers are low)
- Mine comments for insights about positioning
- Don't delete or over-analyze (not every post will perform)

### If Discussion Goes Negative
- Don't respond defensively or argumentatively
- Acknowledge valid criticisms gracefully
- Clarify misunderstandings once, then move on
- Take heated discussion to private channels
- Know when to stop responding

### If You Miss the Mark
- Acknowledge openly if you got something wrong
- Use as learning opportunity
- Don't over-apologize or self-flagellate
- Move forward with better framing next time
