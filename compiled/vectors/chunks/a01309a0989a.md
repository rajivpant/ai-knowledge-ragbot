e braised short rib after learning I don't eat seafood. The meat fell apart at the touch of my fork, and the red wine reduction had a subtle coffee undertone that lingered."

**Detection principle:** Humans who have experienced something provide specific sensory details, personal reactions, and concrete examples. AI generalizes.

### 27. Superficial Depth Without Expertise

**Pattern:** Content covers a topic broadly without demonstrating actual understanding or expertise.

**Characteristics:**

- Restates common knowledge without original insight
- Uses technical terms correctly but superficially
- Avoids controversial or nuanced aspects
- Provides "both sides" artificially balanced treatment
- Lacks specific examples, case studies, or detailed analysis

**Why this signals AI:** LLMs are trained on vast data but lack genuine expertise. They excel at sounding knowledgeable while avoiding depth that would reveal limitations.

## Ineffective Detection Methods

### Indicators That Don't Reliably Signal AI

**1. Perfect Grammar**

- Many skilled human writers have excellent grammar
- Professional editors polish human writing to perfection
- Conversely, AI can make grammatical errors

**2. "Bland" or "Generic" Prose**

- Many humans write blandly
- Corporate communications often sound robotic
- Marketing copy from humans can be formulaic

**3. Use of Common Phrases**

- Phrases like "rich cultural heritage" exist in human writing
- Professional writers use "moreover" and "furthermore"
- The rule of three is taught in writing courses

**4. Presence of Em Dashes**

- Professional human writers love em dashes
- They're taught in style guides
- Some writers overuse them habitually

**5. Use of Emojis**

- Many human writers use emojis appropriately
- Casual blogs and social media normalize emoji use
- Context determines appropriateness

**6. Technical Terminology**

- Experts naturally use jargon
- Industry-specific writing requires technical terms
- Educated audiences expect professional vocabulary

## Detection Confidence Framework

### High Confidence Indicators (Strong signals when present)

1. **Hallucinated citations** (fake sources, broken links, invalid identifiers)
2. **Chatbot communication artifacts** (salutations, valedictions, knowledge cutoff disclaimers)
3. **Placeholder text** left in published content
4. **Markdown formatting mixed** with regular text
5. **Multiple indicators clustering together** in the same piece

### Medium Confidence Indicators (Suggestive when combined)

1. **Consistent rule of three** usage across piece
2. **Negative parallelism** ("not X but Y") appearing multiple times
3. **Section-ending summaries** throughout
4. **Promotional language** for subjects not warranting it
5. **Editorial commentary** ("it's important to note")
6. **Uniform sentence/paragraph structure**
7. **Superficial participial endings** repeatedly

### Low Confidence Indicators (Context-dependent)

1. **Em dash usage** (unless excessive)
2. **Transition words** (unless overused mechanically)
3. **Curly quotes** (platform/style dependent)
4. **Bolding** (depends on publication style)
5. **Generic language** (many humans write generically)

### Evaluation Process

**Step 1:** Scan for high-confidence indicators

- If present: Very likely AI-generated (or copied from AI without editing)

**Step 2:** Count medium-confidence indicators

- 3-4 present: Likely AI-generated
- 5+ present: Very likely AI-generated

**Step 3:** Assess overall pattern

- Uniform structure + promotional tone + shallow analysis = Strong AI signal
- Specific details + personal voice + varied structure = Human-written

**Step 4:** Consider context

- Is this from an established journalist with a portfolio?
- Does other work by this author show similar patterns?
- Is the publication known for quality control?
