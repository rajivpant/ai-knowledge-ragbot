ue blend of..."
- "renowned for..."
- "fascinating"
- "diverse and vibrant"
- "hidden gem"

**Example passage:**

"Nestled in the heart of the countryside, the town of Millbrook boasts a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty. This captivating destination offers visitors a unique blend of historic charm and modern amenities, making it a must-visit location for those seeking an authentic experience."

**The fix:** Replace promotional adjectives with specific, factual descriptions. What specifically makes it interesting? What would someone actually experience there?

### 3. Editorial Commentary and Meta-Analysis

**Pattern:** LLMs inject interpretation, importance judgments, or explicit guidance about what readers should think.

**Common phrases:**

- "it's important to note that..."
- "it is worth mentioning/noting..."
- "notably..."
- "significantly..."
- "interestingly..."
- "surprisingly..."
- "crucially..."
- "no discussion would be complete without..."
- "one cannot overlook..."
- "it should be emphasized that..."

**Why this violates journalistic standards:** Objective reporting presents facts and allows readers to form their own interpretations. These phrases signal editorializing.

**Example:**

"It's important to note that this development represents a significant shift in the industry, and it is worth emphasizing that stakeholders should pay close attention to these emerging trends."

**The fix:** State the facts. Trust readers to determine importance. If something is genuinely important, demonstrate it through evidence rather than declaring it.

### 4. Superficial Analysis with Participial Phrases

**Pattern:** Sentences end with "-ing" phrases that add shallow analytical commentary without substance.

**Structure:** [Statement], [participial phrase adding supposed insight]

**Examples:**

- "The company announced new policies, highlighting its commitment to sustainability."
- "The festival attracts thousands of visitors annually, underscoring the region's cultural importance."
- "The research revealed new findings, demonstrating the team's innovative approach."

**Why this is problematic:** The participial phrase adds apparent depth without providing actual analysis or evidence.

**The fix:** Either provide real analysis with evidence, or let the statement stand on its own.

### 5. Negative Parallelism

**Pattern:** LLMs overuse the "not X but Y" construction to create artificial contrast and drama.

**Common structures:**

- "It's not just X, but Y"
- "It's not only X, but also Y"
- "It is not merely X; it is Y"
- "X represents not only Y but also Z"

**Examples:**

- "The restaurant is not just a place to eat, but a cornerstone of community gathering."
- "This technology is not merely an improvement, but a revolutionary breakthrough."
- "The policy change represents not only a shift in strategy but also a commitment to transparency."

**The fix:** Use this structure sparingly and only when the contrast is genuine and significant.

### 6. Overuse of Transition Words and Formal Conjunctions

**Pattern:** Excessive, stilted use of transitional phrases that create an essay-like or overly formal tone.

**Common overused transitions:**

- "Moreover,"
- "Furthermore,"
- "Additionally,"
- "In addition,"
- "Nevertheless,"
- "On the other hand,"
- "Consequently,"
- "As a result,"

**Why this signals AI:** While professional writing uses transitions, LLMs overrely on a narrow set and place them mechanically rather than naturally.

**Human writing:** Uses varied transitions, including implicit transitions through logical flow, rather than explicit conjunctions at every paragraph break.

**The fix:** Let ideas connect through logical flow. When transitions are needed, vary them and use the simplest option that works.

### 7. Section-Ending Summaries

**Pattern:** Paragraphs or sections end with explicit summary statements, mimicking academic essay structure.

**Common phrases:**

- "In summ
