### Evaluation Process

**Step 1:** Scan for high-confidence indicators

- If present: Very likely AI-generated (or copied from AI without editing)

**Step 2:** Count medium-confidence indicators

- 3-4 present: Likely AI-generated
- 5+ present: Very likely AI-generated

**Step 3:** Assess overall pattern

- Uniform structure + promotional tone + shallow analysis = Strong AI signal
- Specific details + personal voice + varied structure = Human-written

**Step 4:** Consider context

- Is this from an established journalist with a portfolio?
- Does other work by this author show similar patterns?
- Is the publication known for quality control?

## Application Guidelines

### For Content Creators (Augmented by AI)

This is the primary use case for this guide. If you're using AI to assist content creation, these guidelines help you produce professional work rather than publishable slop.

**The fundamental principle:**

AI should be a first-draft tool, not a final product. The value you add comes from revision, expertise, and genuine insight that AI cannot provide.

**Systematic revision process:**

1. **Eliminate formulaic patterns**
   - Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately
   - Reduce mechanical rule of three usage
   - Remove promotional language and editorial commentary
   - Replace generic descriptions with specific details

2. **Add genuine expertise and experience**
   - Include personal anecdotes and specific observations
   - Provide depth beyond surface-level analysis
   - Take clear positions with genuine reasoning
   - Include details only someone with real experience would know

3. **Verify and enhance sourcing**
   - Check all citations are real and relevant
   - Add specific attribution, not vague "experts say"
   - Include original research or first-hand sources
   - Provide verifiable links and references

4. **Inject personality and voice**
   - Use natural transitions, not just formal conjunctions
   - Vary your rhetorical structures
   - Include humor, emotion, or perspective where appropriate
   - Let imperfections remain if they sound natural

5. **Apply the "Human Touch" test**
   - Would a reader recognize this as distinctly yours?
   - Does it include specific knowledge only you'd have?
   - Does it sound like how you actually speak/write?
   - Would anyone else write it exactly this way?

**Before/after example:**

*AI output:*
"The conference was a resounding success, bringing together industry leaders, innovators, and thought leaders for three days of engaging discussions. Attendees praised the event for its comprehensive programming, networking opportunities, and inspiring keynotes. The event stands as a testament to the organization's commitment to fostering collaboration and driving innovation in the field."

*After human revision:*
"About 400 people showed up, which surprised the organizers who'd planned for 250. The keynote on supply chain automation ran 20 minutes long because the Q&A wouldn't stop. I overheard two CTOs in the hallway comparing notes on the same vendor pitch—turns out neither was buying. The real value was in the unscheduled conversations: I came away with three potential partnerships and one job lead I hadn't expected."

### For AI Detection Tools

**Multi-layered approach:**

1. **Pattern matching algorithms**
   - Score content against known AI linguistic patterns
   - Weight high-confidence indicators more heavily
   - Require clustering of multiple indicators

2. **Citation verification**
   - Automatically check links resolve
   - Validate DOIs and ISBNs
   - Flag citations to irrelevant sources

3. **Structural analysis**
   - Measure sentence/paragraph length variance
   - Detect mechanical repetition of structures
   - Identify formulaic organization

4. **Statistical language modeling**
   - Compare against known AI outputs
   - Identify statistically improbable uniformity
   - Detect "regression to the mean" language

5. **Human-in-the-l
