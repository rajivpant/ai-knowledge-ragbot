## MINIMUM VIABLE REVIEW (15-Minute Quick Check)

> Use this for a rapid health assessment. These are the absolute essentials that apply to ANY project.

### 🟢 Security Essentials (5 minutes)
- [ ] **No secrets in code**: Run `git log -p | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"` - should return nothing
- [ ] **Dependencies not ancient**: Check for critical vulnerabilities (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.)
- [ ] **HTTPS only**: All external communication uses TLS
- [ ] **Input validated**: User input is validated before use
- [ ] **Auth exists**: If there are users, authentication is implemented properly

### 🟢 Code Health (5 minutes)
- [ ] **It builds**: Clean build with no errors
- [ ] **Tests exist**: There are some automated tests
- [ ] **Tests pass**: All tests pass
- [ ] **No obvious duplication**: No copy-pasted files or massive repeated blocks
- [ ] **Readable**: A new developer could understand the main flow

### 🟢 Operations Essentials (5 minutes)
- [ ] **README exists**: There's documentation on how to run it
- [ ] **Can be deployed**: There's a documented or automated deployment process
- [ ] **Logs exist**: The application produces logs
- [ ] **Errors tracked**: Errors are logged or sent somewhere visible
- [ ] **Config externalized**: No hardcoded environment-specific values
