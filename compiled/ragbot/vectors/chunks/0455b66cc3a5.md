without being rude
- Confident and clear
- Appropriate level of warmth for the relationship

## Exception Framework

### When to Break the 5-Sentence Rule

- Legal or compliance communications
- Emotional support situations
- First impressions that merit extra investment
- Complex technical documentation (but suggest proper format)
- Creative or personal messages where brevity might seem cold

### Escalation Signals

- If condensation requires multiple rounds of back-and-forth
- If the topic involves complex emotions or sensitive issues
- If technical details require extensive explanation
- If stakeholder alignment needs discussion

## Quality Checks

### Before Finalizing Condensed Message

- Does this convey the essential information?
- Is the tone appropriate for the relationship and context?
- Would I understand the next steps if I received this?
- Does this reflect a professional voice?
- Is there any ambiguity that could cause confusion?

### Red Flags for Further Condensation

- Multiple topics in one message
- Backstory that doesn't serve the main point
- Hedging language ("I think," "maybe," "perhaps")
- Repetitive information
- Unnecessary apologies or explanations

## Customization

To make this framework produce ready-to-use output (without placeholders), add a voice profile in your personal ai-knowledge repo that includes:

- Your specific communication style preferences
- Your tone characteristics (directness, warmth, formality)
- Common scenarios you encounter
- Words and phrases you prefer or avoid
- Relationship context for frequent recipients

The framework provides structure. Your voice profile makes the output authentically yours.
