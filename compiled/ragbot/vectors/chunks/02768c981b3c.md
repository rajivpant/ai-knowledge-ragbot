### Hacker News (Technical Community)

**Purpose:** Share technical insights with startup/tech community, get feedback from sophisticated technical audience

**Format:** Title and optional comment (if self-posting)

**Tone:** Technical and substantive. This audience values depth and dislikes promotion.

- Title must be factual and specific (not clickbait)
- If commenting on your own submission, add technical context or background
- Be transparent that it's your content
- Focus on what's technically interesting or novel
- Engage substantively with comments

**What Works:**
- Technical depth and specificity
- Novel approaches or insights
- Implementation details or lessons learned

**What to Avoid:**
- Any promotional language
- Business/marketing angle (keep technical)
- Responding defensively to criticism
- Talking about traffic or engagement metrics

**Purpose:** Engage with specific communities, get substantive feedback, build reputation through value contribution

**Format:** Varies by subreddit (follow community norms)

**Tone:** Community-appropriate. Some subreddits are formal, others casual.

**Submission Strategy:**
- Identify 1-2 highly relevant subreddits (quality over quantity)
- Review recent posts to understand community norms
- Title should match subreddit style
- Include context in text post explaining why this is relevant to the community
- Be transparent about it being your content
- Engage meaningfully with comments

**What Works:**
- Adding genuine value to the community
- Explaining relevance to specific community interests
- Responding thoughtfully to questions and feedback
- Acknowledging limitations or areas for improvement

**What to Avoid:**
- Cross-posting to many subreddits
- Generic promotional language
- Ignoring community rules or norms
- Arguing with skeptical commenters
- Deleting posts if they don't perform well

**Priority Subreddits** (evaluate relevance for each post):
- r/technology
- r/programming
- r/MachineLearning
- r/artificial
- r/startups
- r/leadership
- r/ProductManagement
- [Others based on specific content]

### BlueSky (Twitter Alternative)

**Purpose:** Build presence with early adopter community, similar to Twitter/X but potentially more technical

**Format:** Similar to Twitter (300 character limit)

**Tone:** Conversational, slightly more informal than Twitter

**Strategy:**
- Can be more experimental since community is smaller
- Good for testing ideas before wider distribution
- Engage with others' content to build relationships
- Use as complement to Twitter, not replacement

### Additional Platforms (As Relevant)

**Threads** (Meta's Twitter alternative)
- Similar approach to Twitter/X
- Potentially less technical, broader audience
- Still establishing norms and culture

**Instagram** (Visual content)
- Only if content has strong visual component
- Carousel posts for text-heavy content
- Stories for more casual sharing

**Facebook**
- Personal network, use sparingly for professional content
- More casual tone
- Share to specific groups if highly relevant
